Extract an MIUI firmware here to be used as the port source. Note that only the system image and file_contexts.bin are required - 
you can ignore the warnings about missing files in base_port when running prepare src script.

MUST BE DEODEXED. Do the deodex manually after extraction if needed.

Recommended [tested by ComsicDan]:
 - xiaomi.eu_multi_MI8_V10.0.4.0.OEACNFH_v10-8.1
